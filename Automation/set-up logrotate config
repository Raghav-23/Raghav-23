WORKPLAN
1. We can change the configuration files under /etc/logrotate.d accordingly.

I have found we have log files that can be rotated under /var/log/sa. And they are not currently under logrotate config.

Config file:

/var/log/sa/* {
        rotate 7
        daily
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 666 root root }


This config file will run daily, create a maximum of 7 archives owned by root and root group with 666 permissions,
compress all logs and exclude only yesterdays and empty log files.

2. 
Copying it into the logrotate directory and changing owner and permissions:
# cp /var/log/sa /etc/logrotate.d/
# chmod 644 /etc/logrotate.d/sa
# chown root.root /etc/logrotate.d/sa

3.
Testing
force logrotate to rotate all logs with -f option.
# logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf/sa

4.
Results
Visit again to /var/log/directory and confirm that the log file was rotated and new log file was created.
